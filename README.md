Faculty Mentor: TBD

Team Members: Javier Padilla, Alexis Torres, Ian Skillman, Kiet Le, Evan LeBel, Jesus Hernandez, Jaime Sanchez

Project Description:
Due to changes in the weather and busy work weeks, it can be challenging to keep track of when you last watered your plants. Our Watering System will automate the need to keep track of the last time you watered your plants and give you more time to enjoy seeing your plants grow. This can create longevity in plants including flowers and plants that can feed humans for years to come. 
Specifically, the project will focus on a single unit that contains a small to medium-sized plant. Attached to the unit will be multiple sensors that will detect/measure/record moisture, temperature, humidity, sunlight, and the water level of an in-unit source. Using a Web UI, the user will be able to manually control and set custom watering settings for the unit. 

Team Composition
4 software engineers developing the software that will use algorithms to automate the watering system based on conditions received from the sensors. All of which can be monitored and manually activated on a remote Web UI. 
3 embedded systems engineers working on communication between sensors and microcontroller, as well as any drivers necessary for the attached LCD display or features that are going to be added. Adding additional electronics to power the microcontroller (including a battery pack and solar cell)

Design Idea:
A plant module will have 3 attached sensors: Light, moisture, and temperature. These sensors will communicate with a custom PCB where the microcontroller will be located. Each plant will have its own sensors and microcontroller, but can also be expanded to accommodate multiple plants per microcontroller. The microcontroller will periodically read the sensors and, based on the sensor data, enable or disable a water pump that delivers water into the plant's soil. The water flow will be fixed, with the amount of water released determined by a time-based factor. The water pump will be connected to a water tank equipped with a sensor to monitor the water level within the tank. This sensor will communicate with the hub, which will be responsible for broadcasting notifications regarding the need to refill the tank. Each microcontroller will communicate with the hub via Bluetooth to periodically send current sensor readings from the plants. The hub can receive multiple data packets from various microcontrollers. Bluetooth will utilize the TCP protocol to prevent interference. The hub will then relay the received data packets over Wi-Fi to be accessed by the PC user for reading and analysis.
